    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my first <a href="/blog/2014/09/15/starting-a-blog-with-jekyll">blog post</a>, I talked about using Jekyll with Poole.  After installing some plugins and customizing the theme, I realized I was doing a lot of the heavy lifting that the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> community has already done.  So this time we are going to migrate our blog over to using Octopress.</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress
bundle install
rake install
</code></pre>

<p>Now personalize the _config.yml.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve followed the original post starting with Poole, or have previous posts in markdown format, copy them over to <code>./source/_posts/</code> path.</p>

<h2>What Octopress give us</h2>

<p>Octopress gives us a lot of bloat&hellip; There are a lot of preinstalled plugins in Octopress that I am not going to use, but I will rip them out later.  You will also see our folder structure is very heavy compared to when we used Poole.  However it affords us some advantages that I am going to utilize and that is better looking themes and decent plugins.</p>

<p>To create a live-reload session with our site let&rsquo;s go ahead and boot up the preview and see what our blog looks like
  <code>rake preview</code></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s create our first post in Octopress with it&rsquo;s included rake task</p>

<pre><code>rake new_post["Jekyll Blogging with Octopress"]
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at the generated post it gives us comments and categories arlready built in.  It also generates the file name and time for us.</p>

<pre><code>---

title: "Jekyll Blogging with Octopress"

</code></pre>

<h2>Installing an Octopress Theme</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">huge list</a> of themes to choose from.  The one that I will be using is <a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade">greyshade</a>.  To install it, in the root of our project we run
<code>
git clone git@github.com:shashankmehta/greyshade.git .themes/greyshade
rake "install[greyshade]"
rake generate
</code>
And refresh our blog and you will see your newly installed theme.</p>

<h2>Deploying Octopress Generated Content</h2>

<p>Unfortunately Deploying with Octopress is not as easy as it was with Poole.  Since Octopress is a local Ruby Blogging Engine, we aren&rsquo;t going to want to commit all the code in our Octopress folder.  We actually need to set up our repo in a rake command <code>rake setup_github_pages</code></p>

<p>This will ask us for our github pages repo and initialize that repo into <code>/_deploy</code>.  You can go there to resolve any merge conflicts you might have with our new engines generated content.</p>

<p>After you have finished that let&rsquo;s go ahead and deploy the code to Github using Octopress rake tasks.</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate our html and commit and push our code to the repo for us.</p>

<h2>Final Conclusions</h2>

<p>Octopress give us a lot of free stuff for a relatively cheap investment.  However, even after all it gives us, it adds a layer of complexity that feels dirty when comparing to something as simple and elegant as Poole.</p>

<p>With Poole we are able to write all of our posts in markdown files and push the markdown files to our repo. This makes accessing the blog from different machines, or even remotely, A BREEZE! We can edit the markdown directly on github!  It also had a simple beauty to it when you looked at the source on Github.</p>

<p>With Octopress we have to run rake tasks that convert our markdown pages to html and then we have to run a deploy script to commit our changes.  This also adds a complexity of setting up your Octopress engine on a <a href="http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/">second machine</a>.</p>

<p>I will stick with Octopress for now on my personal blog because I enjoy the themes and plugins for it, but for the team blog, I will run with Poole and start customizing it to fit our needs.</p>
