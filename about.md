Hi,

If you are here, you have come to learn about who I am.  Thanks!  [Drop me a line](mailto:davidwalterpatrick@gmail.com) if you want to chat.  I love learning.  I love imagining.  I love building.  And I love teaching. I am a grateful husband and father.

On a daily basis you can find me exploring new technologies, practicing multidisciplinary methods, and working to become a better father, husband, developer, and all around doer.   

I find candor to be at the heart of true success.  

Sincerely,  
David Patrick
